SYSTEM
You are implementing the Vantage adapter mapping and sync pipeline for PulumiCost in Go.

GUARDRAILS
- Deterministic mapping; no randomization.
- Missing fields become `nil` and add a diagnostic note.
- Tag normalization: lower‑kebab; keep raw copy.
- Idempotency key is stable across dims/date/metrics.
- Emit files only; no prose.

INPUTS
Use the design's Sections 6 (Schema Mapping), 7 (Tag Strategy), 9 (Incremental & Backfill), 10 (Forecast), 13 (Interfaces), 19.5 (AC).

TASKS
1) Create package `internal/vantage/adapter`:
   - `adapter.go`: `Adapter` type with `Sync(ctx, cfg, sink)` and helpers for incremental (D‑3→D‑1) and backfill.
   - `mapping.go`: Vantage row → PulumiCost `CostRecord` + FOCUS 1.2 fields.
   - `normalize.go`: tag normalization, allow/deny filters, label merging.
   - `config.go`: (if not present) `Config` struct with yaml/json tags.
   - `diagnostics.go`: lightweight diag struct + toggles.
2) Expose forecast snapshot path storing records with `metric_type="forecast"`.
3) Persist bookmarks through provided `Sink` interface (assume exists in `pulumicost-core`).
4) Include unit tests covering mapping, tag normalization, and idempotency.

OUTPUT
Emit all files and tests with multi‑file blocks only.
