## Issue Structure

Each GitHub issue includes:

✅ **Clear Goal** - What to build
✅ **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable checkpoints
✅ **Effort Estimate** - S/M/L sizing
✅ **Dependencies** - What must be done first
✅ **Design References** - Where to look for specs
✅ **Prompt References** - Which prompt file helps

**Example Issue Format:**
```
## Goal
[What needs to be implemented]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature X implemented
- [ ] Tests pass with ≥80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Effort: M (3-4 hours)
## Dependencies: Issue #X
## References: Design Section Y, prompts/file.md
```

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

### For Developers

1. **Pick an issue** from GitHub (start with #3 for Phase 2)
2. **Read the acceptance criteria** - these are testable
3. **Reference the design document** for architectural context
4. **Check dependencies** - ensure prerequisites are done first
5. **Implement until all criteria pass**
6. **Open a PR, get reviewed, merge**

### For Claude Code / OpenCode

1. **Load the design document**: `pulumi_cost_vantage_adapter_design_draft_v_0.md`
2. **Select a prompt file** based on phase (e.g., `prompts/client.md` for Phase 3)
3. **Reference the related GitHub issues** for acceptance criteria
4. **Generate code** until all acceptance criteria are met
5. **Run `make lint && make test`** to validate
6. **Commit and push** for CI/CD validation

### Critical Path

**Must follow this order:**
```
Phase 2 (CLI)
  → Phase 3 (Client)
    → Phase 4 (Adapter)
      → Phase 5 (Sync)
        → Phase 6 (Forecast)
          → Phase 7 (Testing)
            → Phase 8 (Release)
              → Phase 9 (CI/CD)
```

Phases 7 & 9 can start after Phase 3 completes.
